## Prudent Services Ltd
This is my solution for the coding test made by Prudent Services Ltd.

The project uses the following technologies:

 - Reactjs (v. 18.2.0)
 - Bootstrap 5
 - Animate.css

Optimised for the following screens:

- 1440px and above (Desktop and larger screens)
- 768px (Tablet)
- 375px (Mobile)

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo with the following command ``git clone``.
2. Install the dependencies using npm with the command ``npm install``.
3. Run locally with ``npm start``.

## Inside the src folder

`assets/` contains images and icons used in the project.

`components/` stores all the reusable React components I have made.

`data/` includes the dummy data used in the project.

`pages/` stores page components.

`App.css` is where all custom css is written (e.g. resets, utilities, variables, etc.)

`App.js` is the main page of the app.
